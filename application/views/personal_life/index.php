			<p>On March 3, 1924, H.P. Lovecraft married Sonia Haft Green, a successful milliner, pulp fiction writer and an amateur publisher. She was seven years senior to him and kept an apartment in Brooklyn. After the wedding, they settled down there; but trouble erupted soon after.
Green lost her shop and also became ill. Lovecraft tried to find a job, but no one was willing to hire a 34 year old man without job experience. Ultimately Green left New York with a job while he hired another joint in the then-working class Brooklyn Heights, struggling to make ends meet.
On April 17, 1926, H.P. Lovecraft returned alone to Providence and put up with his aunts. Green also wanted to settle down there and open a shop. But his aunts would not allow that and so ultimately they decided to go for mutual divorce; but it never took place.
In early 1937, Lovecraft was diagnosed with cancer of the small intestine. On March 10, he was admitted to Jane Brown Memorial Hospital in Providence and died there on March 15, 1937.
On March 18, 1937, he was buried in the Phillips family plot at Swan Point Cemetery.
In 1977, his fans erected a headstone on his grave, inscribing his name, the dates of his birth and death, and a line from one of his personal letters, which says "I AM PROVIDENCE".
In July 2013, the Providence City Council put a marker at the intersection of Angell and Prospect streets, designating it as ‘H. P. Lovecraft Memorial Square’. The Providence Athenaeum library also houses his bronze bust.

Lovecraft's aunts disapproved of this relationship with Sonia. Lovecraft and Greene married on March 3, 1924, and relocated to her Brooklyn apartment at 793 Flatbush Avenue;she thought he needed to get out of Providence in order to flourish and was willing to support him financially.Greene, who had been married before, later said Lovecraft had performed satisfactorily as a lover, though she had to take the initiative in all aspects of the relationship.She attributed Lovecraft's passive nature to a stultifying upbringing by his mother.Lovecraft's weight increased to 200 lb (91 kg) on his wife's home cooking.

He was enthralled by New York, and, in what was informally dubbed the Kalem Club, he acquired a group of encouraging intellectual and literary friends who urged him to submit stories to Weird Tales; editor Edwin Baird accepted many otherworldly 'Dream Cycle' Lovecraft stories for the ailing publication, though they were heavily criticized by a section of the readership.Established informally some years before Lovecraft arrived in New York, the core Kalem Club members were boys' adventure novelist Henry Everett McNeil; the lawyer and anarchist writer James Ferdinand Morton Jr.; and the poet Reinhardt Kleiner.

On New Year's Day of 1925, Sonia moved to Cleveland for a job opportunity, and Lovecraft left Flatbush for a small first-floor apartment on 169 Clinton Street "at the edge of Red Hook"—a location which came to discomfort him greatly.Later that year the Kalem Club's four regular attendees were joined by Lovecraft along with his protege Frank Belknap Long, bookseller George Willard Kirk, and Lovecraft's close friend Samuel Loveman. Loveman was Jewish, but was unaware of Lovecraft's nativist attitudes. Conversely, it has been suggested that Lovecraft, who disliked mention of sexual matters, was unaware that Loveman and some of his other friends were homosexual.</p>
